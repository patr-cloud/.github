</div>

Our goal is to simplify your DevOps journey and save you time. At Patr, we strongly believe that DevOps should not have to be so complicated and we are tirelessly working towards that goal.

## Focus on your product, not on DevOps

DevOps is just a means to get your product to your customers, and that's what it should always be. Unfortunately, we live in a world where big-tech firms (looking at you, AWS, GCP and Azure) have intentionally made digital infrastructure complex, for the sake of vendor lock-in.

### We're here to change that.

We provide a simple-to-use and easy UI, without sacrificing on the advanced features that you require, all while integrating with your existing cloud provider, to make sure that your data stays safe with you on your own cloud account. We call it the BYOC - Bring Your Own Cloud (hehe) feature. With Patr, automated scale and security is a given, so that you get to focus on your product, rather than the DevOps. We make sure that everything we build is cloud-native, ensuring that you will never forced to be locked into a single cloud vendor.

## We LOVE open source!

We're huge fans of the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org), and our entire backend is written in Rust. We use a lot of open source projects to fuel our codebase and want to give back to the community that gave us so much. It would've been close to impossble for our company to exist without some great open source projects. So apart from some of our internal codebase and client libraries, you'll also find some projects that we would like to open-source for the sake of giving back to the community.

## Our Favorite Projects

This is ideally meant to be a list, but a lot of our open-source projects are being worked upon and yet to be open sourced. So I'm gonna put my favorite one here:

- **[Preprocess](https://github.com/patr-cloud/preprocess)**: This rust crate allows you to preprocess your entire structs before using them. This can be used to declaratively mention the processing and validation required for each field in your struct and enum so that they are mutated and preprocessed as per your requirements before you use them.
